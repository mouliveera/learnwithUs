#Python Numbers
#In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called Integers - just like they are in mathematics.
#
#Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.
#
#Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:

sword_damage = 3
arrow_damage = 5
spear_damage = 2
dagger_damage = 1
fire_damage = 4

total_damage = sword_damage + arrow_damage + spear_damage + dagger_damage + fire_damage
average_damage = total_damage / 5

# don't touch below this line

print(f"total damage is: {total_damage}")
print(f"average damage is: {average_damage}")
